# STEPS.md

This document outlines the step-by-step process taken to build the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) project using React and Express.js.

## Step 1: Build the Backend Application

1. **Initialize the Project**
    - Create a new Node.js project.
    ```bash
    mkdir rbac-backend
    cd rbac-backend
    npm init -y
    ```

-   Install necessary dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install express mongoose bcrypt jsonwebtoken cors dotenv
    npm install --save-dev nodemon
    ```

2. **Set Up MongoDB**

    - Configure a MongoDB database locally or using a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas.
    - Create a `.env` file to store sensitive information (e.g., `DATABASE_URL`, `JWT_SECRET`).

3. **Create Models**

    - Define models for `User`, `Role`, and `Permissions` using Mongoose.

4. **Implement Authentication**

    - Use `bcrypt` for password hashing.
    - Implement login and register APIs.
    - Use `jsonwebtoken` (JWT) for authentication.

5. **Role and Permission Logic**

    - Define roles (`user`, `moderator`, `admin`) and associated permissions.
    - Implement middleware to check permissions for protected routes.

6. **Set Up Routes**

    - Create routes for:
        - Registering new users.
        - Logging in and returning a JWT token.
        - Managing users (CRUD operations) based on roles and permissions.

7. **Handle CORS**

    - Use the `cors` middleware to handle cross-origin requests.

    ```javascript
    const cors = require("cors");
    app.use(cors());
    ```

8. **Test APIs**

    - Use Postman or a similar tool to test the backend endpoints.

9. **Deploy Backend**
    - Deploy the backend application to a cloud service.
    - Ensure the database connection string and other environment variables are properly configured.
    - Address deployment issues (e.g., database connectivity, CORS policies).

## Step 2: Build the Frontend Application

1. **Initialize the React Project**

    - Use Create React App or Vite to scaffold the project.

    ```bash
    npm create vite@latest rbac
    cd rbac
    ```

    - Install necessary dependencies:
        ```bash
        npm install axios react-router-dom
        ```

2. **Build the Home Page**

    - Create a simple home page with navigation to login and register pages.

3. **Create the Register Page**

    - Build a registration form with fields for username, email, password, etc.
    - Connect the form to the backend API for user registration using `axios`.
    - Handle form validation and error messages.

4. **Create the Login Page**
    - Build a login form with fields for email and password.
    - On successful login, save the JWT token in cookies.
    - Redirect the user to the profile page.

## Step 3: Implement Context for User Data

1. **Create User Context**

    - Use the React Context API to store and manage user information globally.
    - Fetch user details from the backend upon login and store them in context.

2. **Use Context Across Components**
    - Access user data in protected routes and other components for role-based rendering.

## Step 4: Build the Dashboard

1. **Create the Dashboard**

    - Design the dashboard layout with a sidebar and main content area.
    - Implement protected routes to restrict access based on roles:
        - Users can see user-specific pages.
        - Moderators can see user and moderator pages.
        - Admins can see all pages.

2. **Implement Different Views**

    - **Normal View**: Standard user data display.
    - **Chart View**: Integrate a chart library (e.g. Recharts) to display data visually.
    - **Settings View**: Display a table of all users with options for search, filter, and pagination.

3. **Add User Management Features**

    - Allow moderators and administrators to:
        - Assign roles and permissions.
        - Edit user details (e.g., name).
        - Ban and delete users.

4. **Implement Profile Page**
    - Create a profile page with two views:
        - **Normal View**: Display user information in a formatted way.
        - **JSON View**: Show raw user data in JSON format.

## Step 5: Make the Application Responsive

1. **Use Tailwind CSS**

    - Ensure the application is responsive for various screen sizes.
    - Test the layout and functionality on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

2. **Optimize Components**
    - Refactor components to improve performance and scalability.

## Step 6: Deploy the Frontend

1. **Deploy to a Hosting Service**

    - Deploy the React application to a hosting service.
    - Configure environment variables to point to the deployed backend.

2. **Fix Deployment Issues**
    - Address issues such as CORS errors by ensuring the backend is configured correctly.
    - Verify that all routes and APIs are functional in the deployed environment.

## Step 7: Testing and Debugging

1. **Test User Flows**

    - Test login, registration, and dashboard access for all roles.
    - Verify role-based permissions and protected routes.

2. **Fix Bugs**
    - Debug and resolve issues encountered during testing.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you have successfully built a fully functional Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system with features like user authentication, role-based routing, protected views, and a responsive design. Both the backend and frontend are deployed and integrated seamlessly.
